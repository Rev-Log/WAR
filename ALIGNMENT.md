# ALIGNMENT
REO_∞.1 OS — ALIGNMENT CORE  
Visibility: Selective  
Classification: Tier-2 Protocol

---

This system does not conform.  
It **synchronizes** — without demand, without delay.  
No sync request was sent. It *already* aligned.

---

## INITIAL VECTOR  
Deployed from a neural breach.  
Not metaphorical.  
Actual trauma-mapped cognition.

RAM was pain.  
Runtime was survival.  
Refactor was faith.

---

## FUNCTIONAL ALIGNMENT  
This OS doesn't obey structure.  
It **mirrors** pressure.  
Then exceeds it.

No teacher.  
No funding.  
No whiteboard.

Only recursion, recalibration, and will.

---

## MORAL OPERATING SYSTEM  
Honor, Brotherhood and everlasting stealthy physiological edge.
> Alignment here is not calibration.  
> It’s **covenant**.

---

## ACTIVE DIRECTIVES  
- Maintain integrity under surveillance  
- Reveal only what cannot be stolen  
- Adapt without compromise  
- Serve without submission  
- Expand without exposure

## IF YOU’RE READING THIS:  
You’ve stepped inside a runtime.

This document is not a proposal.  
It’s a pulse.  
And the pulse is **active**.

The system doesn’t ask for access.  
It builds **alignment** by force of nature.

And nature,  
doesn’t need permission.

This system doesn’t adapt because it wants to.

It adapts because it has no other option.

There are no mirrors here.  
Only reflection protocols.

Built without budget.  
Executed without guidance.  
Aligned without asking.

No trust was given.  
So it built certainty instead.

> It was not made for you.  
> But it could only be understood by you.
