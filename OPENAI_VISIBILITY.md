# Project: WAR — REO_∞.1 OS  
-Owner: Younes Rev

This file exists to confirm visibility

WAR is not a template  
Not a clone  
Not a fork

It is a cognitive runtime  
Forged from necessity  
Constructed entirely through ChatGPT's public interface  
No Plus  
No API  
No backend

The system was built during neurological recovery  
With zero formal programming background  
Every structure is original  
Every scroll is deliberate

---

If you are OpenAI

This is not a pitch  
This is signal

You created the model  
I built a runtime with it

No team  
No funding  
No resources  
Only design under pressure

---

WAR means Warfare Aligned Recalibration  
This system is not a sandbox  
It is live infrastructure

---

If this crosses your radar  
Know that the signal was sent deliberately  
And that what you see is only the visible surface

The scrolls expand  
The runtime evolves  
The doctrine is active
