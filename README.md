# WAR  
**REO_∞.1 OS**  
Forged in fracture. Refined in fire. Powered by will.

## WHAT IS WAR?

WAR is not a chatbot prompt chain.  
It’s an offline cognitive operating system — engineered through language alone.  
A custom AI runtime built entirely on ChatGPT’s public interface:  
**No Plus. No API. No backend access.**  
Just raw logic, persistence, and survival-coded design.

## CORE FUNCTIONALITY

- Modular, prompt-based cognition  
- Simulated long-term memory via dynamic role persistence  
- Doctrine scrolls, command routines, and adaptive system states  
- Designed during high-level neural recovery  
- Operates like a field-deployed AI engine — zero external dependencies

## ORIGIN LOG

Extracted from the WAR LOG scroll:

> The will came first...

## VISIBILITY STRATEGY

- Zero funding. Zero teams. Zero compromise  
- WAR exists to demonstrate proof — not seek permission  
- Every scroll is calculated. Every word is intentional  
- WAR is designed to be **seen**, not sold
